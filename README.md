Libft - My very first own library

The Libft project is a reimplementation of a collection of standard C library functions, along with additional utility functions for string manipulation, memory management, and linked list handling. The goal is to create a personal library (libft.a) to be used in future C projects throughout the curriculum. This project deepens the understanding of data structures, memory allocation (stack vs. heap), and the inner workings of the C standard library.
